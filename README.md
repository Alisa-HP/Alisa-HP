DATA ANALYTICS POTFOLIO
______________________________________________________

Hello, I'm Alisa! I earned a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. However, I've come to realize my passion for collecting and analyzing data. 
When I was young, I enjoyed jotting down the license plate numbers of passing cars near my house! These curious habits have developed alongside my calculation skills.
As a result, I believe that I have the potential to become one of the best data analysts someday! :)

This GitHub repository serves as a platform to share my projects and monitor my progress in the field of Data Analytics.
